== Introduction

jtwfg implements a *task wait for graph* model with a deadlock detection algorithm.

The graph consists of *tasks* and *waits for edges*. As soon as a circular dependency exists, the involved tasks are deadlocked.

jtwfg is a small, standalone java library. The typical use case for someone is having some kind of own "execution engine" implementation
(local, distributed, grid...) with some kind of tasks in it with optionally dependencies between the tasks.
Someone wants to be able to detect deadlocks at runtime in his/her engine automatically.

For more details about deadlock detection algorithms see e.g. http://se.inf.ethz.ch/old/projects/daniel_moser/project_report_deadlock_detection.pdf[Daniel Moser's semester project].

== Usage

=== Step 1

Basically you transform your domain model into the jtwfg-model using a graph builder object

[source,java]
----
GraphBuilder builder = new GraphBuilder();
builder.addTaskWaitsFor("task 1", "task 2");
builder.addTaskWaitsFor("task 2", "task 1");
builder.addTask("task 3");
builder.addTask("task 4");
Graph graph = builder.build();
----

or fluent

[source,java]
----
GraphBuilder builder = new GraphBuilder();
Graph graph = builder.addTaskWaitsFor("task 1", "task 2")
  .addTaskWaitsFor("task 2", "task 1")
  .addTask("task 3")
  .addTask("task 4").build();
----

=== Step 2

As soon as you have a graph instance, you can use the deadlock detector to find deadlocks.

[source,java]
----
DeadlockDetector deadlockDetector = new DeadlockDetector();
DeadlockAnalysisResult analyzisResult = deadlockDetector.analyze(graph);
if(analyzisResult.hasDeadlock()){
   // do something in your domain like throwing an exception or killing a task or ...
}
----

=== More examples

See the link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/libs/jtwfg/Documentation.groovy[executable documentation in src/test/groovy] for more examples.

=== Thread-safety

For simplicity and comfort GraphBuilder and DeadlockDetector are threadsafe.

== Requirements

To use this library you need

* Java 7+
* no other libs

== Installation

=== Gradle based build

Add the following dependency in your gradle build file:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
   jcenter() // Bintray's JCenter repository
}

dependencies {
    compile 'ch.petikoch.libs.jtwfg:jtwfg:1.0.0' // or whatever explicit version

    // or "latest":
    //compile 'ch.petikoch.libs.jtwfg:jtwfg:+'
}
----
